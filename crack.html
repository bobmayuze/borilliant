祝各位童鞋们早日水过ALCOHOL EDU... （虽然事实证明不做也是可以的）





有些学校需要大家去做一个什么 AlcoholEdu, 不能说是没用，但是全套流程走下来，视频啊，问卷调查啊神马的，既浪费时间，而且最后的Exam不过的话还有可能被各种有关部门找麻烦。这里就给大家说一下怎么尽可能快速的搞定这个 AlcoholEdu。



PS: 经过三次的试验，发现前面的POP QUIZ无论做成什么样都是对70%....所以可以乱做，没有关系。但最后的考试要按照下面的来。。。





1、跳过视频



调查问卷上没法做手脚，该是啥就是啥，怎么想的怎么填，鼠标点快一点就过去了。视频可就不行了，没有进度条，也不能关，那几个动画版的还好，真人视频版的实在太过雷人了……一看就是上个世纪80年代的家用录像带水平，而且演员找的十分坑爹，交流还全是废话，我们需要果断跳过。



1、清空地址栏

比如说"http://www.alcoholedu.com/somebullshit"，果断删掉！

2、在清空了的地址栏里输入

javascript:frames["bottomFrame"].setValue(1)

3、按回车，SB视频应该没了有木有，阳光又灿烂了有木有，人生又光明了有木有，又有时间喝着小酒吃花生了有木有！



2、考试题答案



实话讲，前面的那些bs怎么都好说，就当自己学习了。最后的考试最是烦人，问题坑爹，选项忽悠，真不明白为什么要在这种地方为难学生…… 下面附上原题，题目的顺序不一样，后面加***********************************的就是答案，自行搜索即可
